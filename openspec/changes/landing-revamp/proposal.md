# Plan: Asygnuz Landing Page Revamp (SEO, AEO & Lead Gen)

## Context
Asygnuz is an AI and Software Engineering Holding Company ("Ingeniería Aplicada a las Ventas"). The current landing page (asygnuz.com) needs to be completely overhauled to act as a high-converting machine. It must capture leads for three main verticals: Software Development, Artificial Intelligence (AI Agents), and Marketing/Growth. The site must be optimized for traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO - for AI search engines like Perplexity, ChatGPT, etc.).

## Goal
Transform the Asygnuz landing page into a lead generation funnel.
1. Increase conversion rate for High-Ticket B2B clients.
2. Structure the content to clearly communicate our unique value proposition: "We don't just build software, we build sales systems."
3. Implement technical SEO/AEO best practices (Schema markup, fast loading, semantic HTML).

## Scope
- **Copywriting:** Rewrite headlines, sub-headlines, and CTAs (Call to Actions) focusing on the pain points of our Avatar (agencies, clinics, high-ticket info-products).
- **Architecture:** Restructure the page into clear sections (Hero, Problem, Solution/Services, Case Studies/Authority, Contact Form).
- **SEO/AEO:** Add structured data (JSON-LD), optimize Meta tags, ensure H1/H2 semantic hierarchy, and write content that answers direct business queries (e.g., "How to automate my sales with AI?").
- **Tech Stack:** The project is likely built in Astro/Next.js (to be verified). The revamp will respect the existing framework but optimize components for Core Web Vitals.

## Squad Assigned
- **CMO & Strategist:** Funnel design and value proposition.
- **Copywriter:** Persuasive writing (AIDA/PAS).
- **SEO Specialist:** Technical markup and keyword intent.
- **Ego (Frontend) & MarTech:** Implementation of the UI and lead capture form (hooking it up to a CRM/webhook).
