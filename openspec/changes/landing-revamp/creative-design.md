# Creative & UX/UI Design (Creative Squad)

## 1. Visual Identity & Vibe (Creative Director)
**The Asygnuz Feeling:**
- **Premium B2B:** The site must feel expensive, trustworthy, and technologically advanced.
- **Color Palette:** Dark Mode by default. Deep blacks/navy for the background, sharp neon accents (e.g., Cyber Blue or Electric Green) to highlight CTAs and tech elements.
- **Typography:** Sans-serif, geometric, highly legible (e.g., Inter, Space Grotesk, or Plus Jakarta Sans). High contrast for readability.

## 2. UI/UX Prototyping (UI/UX Designer)
**Layout Structure:**
- **Navigation:** Sticky, glassmorphism effect. Minimal links (Services, Case Studies, Contact).
- **Hero:** Split layout. Left: Typography and CTA. Right: 3D abstract element or a high-quality dashboard mockup showcasing "Systems".
- **Social Proof:** Grayscale logos of tech partners or clients immediately below the fold.
- **Services (Bento Box UI):** Instead of boring columns, use a "Bento Box" grid layout. It feels modern, Apple-esque, and highlights the 3 pillars (Dev, AI, Marketing) organically.
- **Lead Capture:** Instead of redirecting to a boring Typeform page, the form should open in a sleek, full-screen overlay modal, keeping the user immersed in the brand.

## 3. Video & Motion Graphics (Video Editor)
**Assets Required:**
- **Hero Background:** A subtle, slow-moving abstract looping video (particles, nodes connecting) that doesn't distract from the H1 but screams "AI & Tech".
- **VSL (Video Sales Letter):** Embedded in the "Problem/Solution" section. A 2-minute highly edited video with motion graphics explaining how the Asygnuz framework multiplies revenue. Must have captions and fast-paced B-roll.
